# odin-landing-page
Second odin project
A more complete project that will test everything
I've learned t'ill now.


Finished the project for the most part 03/14/2024
I used flexbox for most containers. I also added containers
as I was having difficulty putting stuff underneath with
a single container for everything for ie:
the photo grid and the quote author.
I did in fact use a lot of padding in the whole project, 
and I had a problem with a padding on the call to action
sign-up container, which I couldn't resolve. Anyways 
fun project.
